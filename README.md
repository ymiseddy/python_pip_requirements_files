# Seddy's Python/Pip Requirements files

Pip Requirements files I use in various contexts. I use this repository for my
own reference; however, feel free to use them for your own projects.

To use them, just copy the file you want to use to your project's root directory
and run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I recommend you use a virtualenv for your project, but that's up to you.

To set up a virtualenv using Python 3, run:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

To activate the virtualenv, run:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To deactivate the virtualenv, run:

```
deactivate
```
